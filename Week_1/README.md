### Simulator
- A simulator is a software tool that verifies the functionality of a digital circuit by applying test inputs and observing the outputs. This allows designers to check their design before implementing it on hardware.
- A simulator is mainly used to simulate and validate your circuit design.
- On Day 1, we will be using the open-source simulator Icarus Verilog (iverilog).
- A stimulator provides changes in the input values to test how the circuit responds.
- The output of the stimulator is typically a VCD (Value Change Dump) file, which records signal transitions during simulation.
