### Simulator
- A simulator is a software tool that checks your digital circuitâ€™s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.
- Simulator is tool used for simulate your design.
- In Day 1, we are using open source simulator iverilog.
- Stimulator is looking for the change in the values of input.
- Output of the stimulator is the vcd file.
